# Mine Sweeper
A customizable mine-sweeper game for users to play through interactions in C. <br /> Queues implemented with linked lists and dynamic memory are used to store the positions of mines for the result displays based on the progress of the game. <br /> 
(Also my first game written in C!)

# How to play?
Simply download all 3 files (My_Mine_Sweeper.h, My_Mine_Sweeper.c, and main.c), run the main.c file on your compiler and have FUN :)!
