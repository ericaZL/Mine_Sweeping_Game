# Mine Sweeper
A customizable mine-sweeper game for users to play through interactions in C. <br /> Queues implemented with linked lists and dynamic memory are used to store the positions of mines. <br /> The progress and the result of the game are displayed as a simple grid-based gameboard to the screen. <br /> 
(Also my first game written in C!)

# How to play?
Simply download all 3 files (My_Mine_Sweeper.h, My_Mine_Sweeper.c, and main.c), run the main.c file on your compiler and have FUN :)!
